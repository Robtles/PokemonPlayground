# PokemonPlayground
A playground project just to improve my knowledge in Swift and use of many libraries.
Since I still have a lot to learn with Swift, any advice is more than welcome!

## Swift libraries planned to be used:

#### UI and image handling
- **Spring:** to simplify animations
- **RAMPaperSwitch:** nice tool to paint a whole cell containing a switch
- **Kingfisher:** tool to handle image cache

#### Networking
- **Alamofire** and **Moya**: HTTP networking and API abstraction layer simplified

#### JSON mapping
- **SwiftyJSON** and **ObjectMapper**: to simplify fetching a JSON response and mapping it to an object

#### Local database
- **Realm**: to store data locally once downloaded

#### Swift extensions
- **EZSwiftExtensions**: nice extensions like *String.length*

## Other tools I'd like to use for this project:

#### API key handling
- **Cocoapods-keys**: great tool, but I couldn't find a Pokemon API requiring to use a private key yet, so...

#### List handling
- **IGListKit**: replacing occurrences of UITableViews by IGListKits
